# Welcome to Speed Bump: A fast card drinking game!

Click on **´Play Here´** to begin. All cards are automatically shuffled once. If desired, players can call for more shuffles or a new deck at any point.

After each round, the remaining cards are left aside in an imaginary dump pile until a new deck is called. If a new deck isn't called by the player, the game will automatically create new deck over and over again.

## The Rules are Simple

Get four cards and take your guesses. You lose, you drink. Win all rounds and everybody else drinks. Yes, you DON'T have do play drinking, this can be a normal card game (but where's the fun in that tho, right?).

## How to Play a Round
The game deals cards to each player in rounds and he/she must...:

1. ...guess the color of the card (red or black).
2. ...guess whether the card value is higher or lower.
3. ...guess whether the card value is between or outside the previous two cards.
4. ...guess the suit of the card (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades).
