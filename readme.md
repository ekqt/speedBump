# Welcome to Speed Bump: A fast card drinking game!

The dealer deals four cards to each player, beginning on their left. Remaining cards are left aside in the pile. The pile is left aside as it will be used at the end of the round.

## Rules

Deal four cards and take your guesses. You lose, you drink. Win all rounds and all other players drink.

## Dealing Pattern
The dealer deals cards to each player in 4 rounds and each time the player gets the answer wrong, he/she must drink:

1. Player must guess the color of the card (black or red).
2. Player must guess whether the card is higher or lower.
3. Player must guess whether the face value of the card is between or outside the previous two cards.
4. Player must guess the suit of the card (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades).
